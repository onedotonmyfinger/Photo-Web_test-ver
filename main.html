With honor, I will present my pictures to you. I took those photos
with Sony A7m3 and later edited with some tools. I was quite reluctant to use splendid colors because
I want people watching my pictures to focus on objects and scale of them, not augurated tones.
So, I decide to use only Black-and-white tone with my picture to make people fully immerse to world I represent in the picture.
